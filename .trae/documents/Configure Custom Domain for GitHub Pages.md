I have analyzed your repository and identified the issue. While you have correctly configured the DNS on Aliyun, your GitHub Pages repository is missing the required configuration to recognize the custom domain.

Here is the plan to fix it:

1.  **Create a `CNAME` file**:
    -   I will create a file named `CNAME` in the root directory of your repository.
    -   This file will contain a single line: `me.kuangweihua.com`.
    -   This tells GitHub Pages to serve your site at this custom domain.

2.  **Update `_config.yml`**:
    -   I will update the `url` setting in your `_config.yml` file from `https://weihuakuang.github.io` to `https://me.kuangweihua.com`.
    -   This ensures that links generated by Jekyll (like canonical URLs and sitemaps) use your new domain.

Once these changes are pushed to GitHub, it may take a few minutes (up to an hour, though usually faster) for the changes to propagate and for the site to be accessible via `me.kuangweihua.com`.
